# The list of classes to train on. Can be a subset of what is labeled
classes:
  - Crucifix

# Iterations per class. Min of 4000 total applied by recommendation from AlexeyAB
iterations_per_class: 2000

# Whether to include simulated data while training
use_simulated: True

# Whether to include hand_labeled data while training
use_hand_labeled: True

# Whether to include negatives while training.
use_negatives: True
# The negative to positive ratio
negative_ratio: 1

# How many test samples out of total samples
test_ratio: .1

# The larger this number the slower the training but requires less memory
# If you get a cuda error, increace this number by 2* up to 64
subdivisions: 4

# Height and width of the neural net. Not related to image size.
height: 416
width: 416

# The neural net architecture to use. 
# As of right now yolov3-tiny is the only one that fits on a jetson TX1
